	'Suraiya Ataur Medical Center (SAMC) is a non-profit medical clinic situated in the village of Chondipur, Bangladesh. It was established in 2014 to serve the basic health needs specifically of women and children of the village and surrounding rural areas. Many families live below the poverty level and access to the closest health facility is a challenge because of distance and cost.';

	'SAMC also provides critical education on nutrition, reproductive health and hygiene. Classes and workshops are held in the clinic and in the adjoining school for women.';
const p3 =
	'Our center is staffed by female salaried professionals. The medical doctor is available eight days a month, while a physician’s assistant is available for services four days a week. Three staff members help with the administration duties and young girls from the nearby school offer volunteer services. Serious medical cases which are beyond the scope of our center’s services are referred to a local hospital in the area. Currently, the clinic sees 800 patients monthly and the numbers continue to grow.';
const p4 =
	'SAMC medical services are essentially free. A nominal fee of five BDT, equivalent to less than five cents in USD is charged per doctor visit, which covers all costs including any prescribed medications. ';
