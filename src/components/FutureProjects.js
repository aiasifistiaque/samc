			<h3>Our Future Endeavors/Projects</h3>
			<p>
				We are proud of the services SAMC is able to provide as a result of your
				continued support and generous donations. We have even more plans in the
				future to reach as many people as possible with health services, health
				education, and scholarships for women who wish to attend nursing or
				medical school. Please see below for a few of our current projects in
				the pipeline for 2021:
			</p>
			<li>
				Regular seminars and webinars for virtual experts from Dhaka (the
				capital city of Bangladesh) and globally to present on a variety of
				issues including:
				<div style={{ padding: '10px 50px' }}>
					<li>Mental Health</li>
					<li>Hygiene</li>
					<li>Nutrition</li>
					<li>Pre-natal, Pregnancy, and Post-Natal Health</li>
					<li>Menopause</li>
					<li>High/Low Blood Pressure</li>
					<li>Physiotherapy</li>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				Introducing domestic violence awareness through webinars and
				presentations by experts
			</li>
			<li>Creating support groups for victims of domestic violence</li>
			<li>
				Increase the number of scholarships we distribute to students hoping to
				go to nursing or medical school. Currently, we provide one scholarship
				annually which covers the costs of 4 years of tuition for one student.
				We are hoping to be able to award at least 2 or 3 a year by next year,
				and gradually increase it to at least 5 scholarships a year.
			</li>
			<li>
				Expansion of SAMC by constructing an adjacent building that will serve
				as the Suraiya Ataur Nursing School (SANS). SANS will give students from
				the village and surrounding areas the opportunity to take courses and
				earn a degree in Nursing to further their education. They will then have
				the choice to intern at our SAMC clinic.
			</li>
