				Suraiya Ataur Medical Clinic (SAMC) had been closed since end of March
				2020 when Covid-19 pandemic spread to Bangladesh. The clinic primarily
				serves only women and children from the village and other neighboring
				villages. The clinic was closed for about 6 months and during closure,
				the clinic was able to provide patients with only routine medications.
				Fortunately none of the staff, predominantly women, lost their jobs.
				They continued to get paid during closure. Six Staff members includes
				the Doctor, Paramedic, Administrator, Receptionist, Cleaner and a Guard.
				Unfortunately for many patients, it was a hardship as they were not able
				to get the medical help the clinic normally provided.
			</p>
			<p>
				Situation around Chondipur and neighboring villages seems to have
				minimal reported cases of Covid19 patients. There have not been any
				reported cases from the clinic itself. Great news for the locals and
				neighboring villagers is that the clinic was recently able to re-open
				safely and resume their services as of September 26th. SAMC had already
				made some changes during closure to accommodate patient’s medicine
				needs. About 15 patients came the first day of reopening which was a
				positive sign. Unfortunately because of the current situation, the
				clinic isn’t able to have any Volunteers from the nearby school to help
				as they had in the past. The school is also still closed for the
				pandemic.
			</p>
			<p>
				The SAMC is able to resume their normal services with extra precautions
				for Covid-19. For staff and patient’s safety PPE supplies such as masks,
				gloves and hand-washing facilities are being provided by 2 the clinic
				without any extra cost to patients. Clinic staff are also educating the
				patients about cleanliness and safe distancing requirements during this
				time. There have been patients who either don’t understand or have
				disagreements about what they need to do in order to keep everyone safe.
				The Staff has been instrumental in mitigating problems, for the most
				part, patients eventually complied as they understood that they would
				not be attended to otherwise. The clinic is on the right path today and
				everyone is feeling fortunate to be able to continue to serve the
				community.
