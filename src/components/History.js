				The medical clinic is rooted in the vision and work of Maulana
				Hedayatullah(1881-1945) and his beloved wife Sayeda Mehrunnesa
				(1901-1951). Maulana Hedayatullah was a noted scholar, teacher and
				healer. He had spent 15 years of his adult life away from home absorbed
				in intense study and meditation with teachers in Northern India. 
			</p>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				Maulana Hedayatullah ministered tirelessly to the villagers of northern
				Bengal and in his lifetime grew a large following. He travelled
				extensively. Often his wife joined him in his work of healing through
				herbal medicine, spiritual practices and prayers.
			</p>

			<h3>1967</h3>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				Both husband and wife believed ardently in the critical need to empower
				women through education. They worked hard to overcome patriarchal
				traditions. To a conservative audience they used scripture and common
				sense to explain that female education would benefit immensely family
				and society. Consequently, a school for women was established in .. 
				supported by villagers and funded primarily from sales of mangoes from
				the orchards of the Rahman family.
			</p>
			<h3>1971</h3>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				Upon their death, the responsibility for the school fell on the
				shoulders of their eldest son, Muhammad Ataur Rahman, who chose to
				become a diplomat. Along with his wife Suraiya, they travelled all over
				the world. Ataur Rahman had the distinction of becoming Ambassador of
				two countries in his lifetime: first, representing Pakistan and when in
				1971 the country split in two, Ambassador of Bangladesh.  For over four
				decades they supported from overseas the village school and a number of
				other village projects from their personal funds, assets and
				connections. Throughout their career they spent every single vacation in
				their ancestral village taking care of the needs of the school and other
				community ventures.
			</p>
			<h3>1990</h3>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				In 1990, both Ataur and Suraiya Rahman passed away in the same year.
				Their children, Kamal, Jamal and Aysu took over the work of caretaking
				the school. From 1992 to 2000 the Interfaith Community Sanctuary in
				Seattle sustained and grew the school through fundraising and donations.
				Because of the generosity of well-wishers in Seattle, the School for
				Women in Chondipur is today a flourishing institution, fully accredited
				and supported financially by the Government.
			</p>
			<h3>1993</h3>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				From 1993 onwards, Interfaith Community Sanctuary continued to raise
				funds through community donations annually to support the missions of
				the school. These fundraisers and generous donors were culminated into a
				project called “Friends of Mohdipur,” which has now become the Suraiya
				Ataur Medical Center..
			</p>
			<h3>2012</h3>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				Around 2012, Aysu decided to finally chase her dream of expanding the
				vision of her grandparents and build on the work of her parents. Aysu,
				who is a medical doctor, felt inspired to open a medical clinic for
				women and children. Thanks to the continued support of our local
				community within the Interfaith Community Sanctuary, we were able to
				begin raising funds for this new &#39;project.
			</p>
			<h3>2014</h3>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				In 2014, Aysu’s older brother Kamal who owns businesses in Dhaka,
				Bangladesh acquired land adjacent to the school, and commenced work on
				building a medical clinic. He and his staff continues to provide
				financial help and operational expertise.
			</p>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				Since 2014, Interfaith Community Sanctuary has been extraordinarily
				active in supporting and expanding the medical clinic. Through regular
				fundraising and generous donations, the clinic is able to serve an ever
				growing number of women and children not only from Chondipur but also
				from neighboring villages.
			</p>
			<p style={styles.content}>
				Enthused and excited by the palpable benefits of the clinic, village
				elders in Chondipur requested the Rahman family to build a nursing
				school. This institution would offer much needed professional training
				and employment to girls graduating from the school, and to other women
				in neighboring villages.  Land has already been purchased in close
				proximity to school and clinic, and construction of nursing school has
				started. There are ongoing talks with health officials to secure
				government accreditation. It is anticipated that this phased project of
				the ambitious nursing school will take two years to complete.
